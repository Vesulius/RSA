#### Week 2 progress report

This week I started the project and created the utilities and tests for the project.

The project now has checkstyle checking and simple javadoc. I added filesystem class that can be used to read
and write to files and will be used in the future to save the encrypted text. Also added junit tests for this
class.

The RSA algorithm is still severely in progress as it can only encrypt and decrypt single letters.
