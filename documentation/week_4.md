#### Week 4 progress report

This week was mostly stuggling against gradle and github actions. The gradle workflow refused to work function probably because different project struckture than what github expects ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

The program functionality is coming together. I created simple ui class and app logic class that connects the ui to app functions. Currently its possible to write small messages to be encypted to a file encyption.txt. 

Also changed RSA class to use primes generated by Primes class.
