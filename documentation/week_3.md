#### Week 3 progress report

This week I studiet about different prime test and created prime generator.

After learning about generating large primes I decided to create Miller-Rabin primality test. Right now it is still quite slow but several improvements can be made.  Miller-Rabin test is part of MR Baillieâ€“PSW primality test that can be implemented for bether performance.

Also fixed some broken tests that did not work properly with junit5.
