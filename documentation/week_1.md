#### Week 1 progress report

This week I chose a project and created git repository with initial documentation.  

Most of the time was spent on choosing the project and researching different algorithms. The RSA encryption was chosen at the last minute so the project scope is still quite fuzzy. I will add to it in the coming week as I dvelve into the subject more closely.
