#### Week 6 progress report

The program is basically finished. The core encryption and primary generation is done. There are still several improvements to be made next week. More junit tests need to be added as the test coverage is not as high as I want it to be. Test coverage could be automated to show on the testing raport.

I also started to work on the performance testing witch is still very work in progress. Also found the bug that caused gradle run command to cause nullpointer exeption.

Again this week also wrote a preer review and read the one written for me.
