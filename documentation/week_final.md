#### Final week progress report

Last few weeks were taken litle too easily so this was crunchweek :D

Testing class and performance report took most of the time. MR-test is quite difficult to test for and the performance report was re-written multiple times. And every rewrite testing class needed to be redesinged. I think this created quite good testing methods and I am happy with the results.

Overall this project turned out to be relly interesting subject even though it was selected almost at random. I wished i could have delved deeper into the actual maths but it was out of scope for this project.

In hindsight I could have planned my schedule bether. As the hours report shows my effort in this project is remenicent of function x^2 with high effort in the beginning and end and slump in the middle.

Despite the haistly start fourtunately I had already took couple 'lab' cources so this time I was more clear about the big picture from the start and didin't code myself into a corner.

Overall I think I did pretty well and this was definitely the best and most interesting 'lab' cource yet!
