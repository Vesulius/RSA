#### Week 5 progress report

This week was focused on doing several minor updates that i had neglected. Lots of small refactoring and packet changes. Also finally created testing document. This needs to be worked on more in the upcoming weeks. Generated keys are saved to textfiles as originally pictured. 

Also wrote a preer review and read the one written for me witch was actually very helpfull.
